Stateful Window Operations
==========================
There are two kinds of operations that we can perform on streaming data typically:

1. Stateless operations - are transformations which are applied on a single stream entity, a single record.

2. Stateful operations - consider multiple streaming entities at the same time. These are transformations which accumulate
   across these multiple entities.

A lot of stream processing involves using window operations. Windows are when we want to accumulate information across a particular window of time
in a stream. Window transformations are a way to operate on a subset of the streaming data.
Spark supports window operations based on a certain time interval; that means transformations can be applied on all entities within a time window,
and the kind of transformations can be sum, min, max, average; any aggregation.


Tumbling, Sliding and Global Windows
====================================
Spark supports the tumbling, sliding, and the global window.
Let's assume that we have a stream of data. The different entities in our streaming data come in over a period of time.
That means every entity is at a different timestamp.

Tumbling Window
---------------
The tumbling window is a window which is a fixed interval of time. The window size is fixed. In tumbling windows, time is non-overlapping.
That means a particular streaming entity can belong to just one window. The time interval that defines a tumbling window is fixed,
but the number of entities within a window can differ. So if you have a lot of entities come in at a particular point in time,
such as error messages from your website logs, there will be many entities at a particular fixed interval of time when the error occurs.
The tumbling window is so called because it tumbles over the streaming data in a non-overlapping manner.
No streaming entity is part of more than one window in a tumbling window.

Sliding Window
--------------
The sliding window, once again, has a fixed window size, which is based on the window interval.
Sliding windows differ from tumbling windows in the fact that consecutive windows are overlapping in time.
This overlap period is defined as the sliding interval. Once again, as in the case of tumbling windows, the number of streaming entities
within a window will defer based on how many entities came in in a particular interval of time.
When you use a sliding window, a particular entity can belong to more than one window.
As the window slides over, one or more streaming entities can belong to consecutive windows.
Sliding windows tend to be the most commonly used kind of windows because they are great for showing how trends gradually change over time.

Global Window
-------------
If you consider data accumulated across the stream as a whole from the very beginning of time, that is a global window.
